# pyData7
## Introduction

The original project was created by [@electricalwind](https://github.com/electricalwind/). The original project can be found [here](https://github.com/electricalwind/data7).

This project will be fully written in Python and will make use of many Python libraries available.

The goal of this project is to regroup all the valid and useful data provided by [NIST](https://nist.gov/). NIST is the National Institute of Standards and Technology, which provides the official API to all the [CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/vulnerabilities) data. Since the data is provided by many sources, it is not always consistent and can be hard to use. Therefore, the goal of this project is to provide data retrieval and data analysis tools to make the data more useful.

The project will use a regular expression (regexp) created by @electricalwind, which will be used to extract Git repositories from the CVE data. Without this filtering, there would be over 800k links, many of which are no longer valid, and many are not Git repositories.

This project will not be by any means perfect, so if anyone wants to contribute, feel free to do so. As this project is my bachelor project, and after it is finished, I will no longer work on it. Therefore, if anyone wants to take over the project, feel free to do so.
